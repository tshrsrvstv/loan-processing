# Loan Processing 
With increasing cases of loans given by Private and Nationalized Banks becoming NPAs giving a severe blow to national economy it is the need of the hour that banks should have proper tools for evaluating the repayment capacity of an individual or organization applying for a loan with greater accuracy. The system that can accurately determine a customer's failure of EMI payment can also help Banks to give pre-emptive promotional offers to these customers for motivating them to pay their EMIs on time thus improving business for banks and credibility of customers.
